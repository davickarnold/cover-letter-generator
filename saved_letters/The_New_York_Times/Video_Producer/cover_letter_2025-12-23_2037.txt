New York, NY  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Producer position at Wirecutter. With nearly a decade of professional experience producing and shooting videos for local and national news outlets and entertainment media, I am confident in my ability to create polished, engaging video content aligned with Wirecutter’s mission to bring thorough and trustworthy product recommendations to viewers.

My background includes producing short- and long-form digital video content, conducting on-camera interviews, shooting with professional and prosumer cameras, and editing using Adobe Premiere and other editing tools. At Access Hollywood, I consistently produced content that amassed hundreds of thousands of views by optimizing video for social platforms and SEO best practices, demonstrating my ability to create video stories tailored to audience engagement and platform demands. My experience in live and recorded on-camera hosting and interviewing further strengthens my storytelling capabilities.

Throughout my roles at NY1 Spectrum News and News 12, I independently shot, edited, and produced general assignment news stories and breaking coverage. I am experienced with newsroom workflows, coordinating with editors and photographers to manage file handoffs and meet tight deadlines. My bilingual fluency in English and Spanish also allowed me to deliver content for diverse audiences, adding versatility in communication and content creation.

While I have not yet held formal responsibility for managing video gear or lighting design to a technical expert level, I am well-positioned to quickly adapt and support these production aspects. Additionally, my extensive experience navigating newsroom editorial processes and collaborating closely with creative teams prepares me to work effectively with Wirecutter’s creative and newsroom personnel.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Wirecutter’s growing video journalism initiatives. Thank you for your time, and I hope to discuss how my background and skills can support your team.

Sincerely,  
Arnold Davick
