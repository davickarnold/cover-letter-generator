Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the multiskilled journalist position at BS Newspath. With nearly a decade of experience as a reporter, producer, and multimedia journalist in local and national news markets, I have developed a strong ability to cover breaking and scheduled news events, often working independently under tight deadlines. My background aligns closely with the responsibilities you describe, including shooting, writing, editing, and producing stories for both linear and digital platforms.

At NY1 Spectrum News and Verizon FiOS1 News, I regularly pitched, developed, shot, and edited stories on a wide range of topics including breaking news, politics, crime, and community affairs. This included live coverage and working solo in the field, often handling camera work and editing independently using Adobe Premiere, LumaFusion, and Sony Vegas Pro. I have experience managing workflows with photographers and editors and have contributed bilingual reporting in English and Spanish. Additionally, I am fully comfortable communicating and collaborating with news teams to meet editorial standards and deadlines, which supports a productive newsroom environment.

More recently, as a Digital Video Producer at Access Hollywood, I expanded my skills in digital video production, scriptwriting, SEO optimization, and content publishing on CMS and social platforms, which complements the multiskilled storytelling approach you seek. My freelance hosting work further demonstrates my ability to represent organizations professionally in public-facing roles and conduct engaging interviews.

While I have not used Avid specifically, my proficiency with industry-standard editing tools and my technical troubleshooting experience in newsroom and field production settings make me confident I can quickly adapt. I also meet the physical requirements for field reporting and hold a valid driver’s license with a good driving record. My education includes a strong foundation in journalism principles, and I bring a solid understanding of newsroom workflows and editorial judgment.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to BS Newspath, where I can contribute to compelling, accurate reporting for your broad affiliate network. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support your team.

Sincerely,  
Arnold Davick
