Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Video Editor position for your conversational video podcast series as advertised. With nearly a decade of professional experience in video editing, producing, and multimedia journalism, I bring a solid foundation in editing long-form video content, working with multi-camera footage, and managing audio and video synchronization to ensure clear, engaging storytelling.

In my previous roles, including my time as a Digital Video Producer at Access Hollywood and a News Reporter for NY1 Spectrum News and News 12, I have edited video packages, frequently working with multiple camera sources and independently shot footage. I am proficient with Adobe Premiere, which I used extensively to produce polished news reports and longer form content, often incorporating graphics and applying color correction and audio adjustments to enhance the final product. My experience includes managing large volumes of footage under tight newsroom deadlines, editing in narrative sequences that maintain clear and coherent storytelling flow, much like the requirements of your podcast project.

Additionally, I have on-site collaboration experience from working in fast-paced newsroom environments and digital video production settings, ensuring smooth communication with photographers, editors, and production teams. This aligns well with your hybrid work environment and onsite sessions in New York City.

While I have not specifically edited long-form podcast material with three-camera setups and separate audio tracks, my multimedia journalism background, combined with my digital video production skills and familiarity with multi-camera workflows, makes me well-positioned to adapt quickly and deliver outstanding results. I am eager to bring my commitment to high-quality video editing and storytelling to your team and contribute to producing compelling podcast episodes.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills can support your production goals.

Sincerely,  
Arnold Davick
